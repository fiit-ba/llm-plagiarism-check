However, they exhibit significant differences in their approach and implementation. Code Sample 1 uses a nested for-loop within the main method to populate the matrix and a separate method to calculate the diagonal sum. Code Sample 2, on the other hand, integrates the input and diagonal sum calculation within a single method and includes additional comments and different variable names. These differences suggest that the code samples are independent implementations of the same problem rather than instances of plagiarism.

}",True,,False,"The two code samples share a similar structure and logic for reading and displaying an array of integers in reverse order. Both use a `for` loop to read 10 integers into an array and another `for` loop to print the array in reverse order. However, there are notable differences in the code style, such as the use of comments, variable names, and the inclusion of additional imports in the second sample. These differences suggest that while the core logic is similar, the implementations are distinct enough to indicate independent work rather than direct copying.

}",True,,False,"The two code samples share a similar structure and logic for reading and displaying an array of integers in reverse order. Both use a `for` loop to read 10 integers into an array and another `for` loop to print the array in reverse order. However, there are notable differences in the code style, such as the use of comments, variable names, and the inclusion of additional imports in the second sample. These differences suggest that while the core logic is similar, the implementations are distinct enough to indicate independent work rather than direct copying.
